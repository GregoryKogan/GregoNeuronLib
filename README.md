# GregoNeuronLib

This is my interpretation of The Coding Train's Neural Network Toy library.
I added a few features for myself. This lib supports many layers in networks.
Also I improved mechanism for saving trained neural network as JSON file and
restoring it back. I use this library in most of my projects connected with AI.
It's really simple and powerful enough for most of my tasks.

If you want to learn more about original library, you should watch
The Coding Train's video series about it:
